# simple-miniature-piv

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Particle Image Velocimetry(PIV) reasearch, I want to share the experience of building a very simple PIV with low budget(around $1500), if you don't have budget for a standart PIV(usually cost around 70k dollars), and don't have the experience in build a PIV by yourself. 


### Select the parts
* For a typical PIV system:
  * Camera: Camera with trigger. The commercial video camera can't be applied here since the camera shutter need to be syncronized with the Laser pulse and global shutter. The cheap industrial camera cost around $1000-2000. A JAI Go5000 cost around $1000. I've test the camera in my research, it works well.
  * Laser: In amazon,15W blue continues Laser for engraving use is only 50-100 dollars, please carefully check the item description, choose the one can change focal length. Through a cylindrical lens, the laser beam could be expanded to a laser sheet, I ordered a 8mm cylindrical lens from Thorlabs, you can use other focal length lens for your application
  * A computer: In my research, I selected a ARM single-chip board with Ubuntu runing on it. But for a lab experiment, any Windows laptop works. Just need to check if there's a high speed USB3 port in your computer.  
  * Syncronizer: An Arduino Uno is fairly enough for most PIV research. I do not encourage to use the system in high speed applications. 

  My cost of the parts:
  * Camera: JAI GO5000M, less than 1000 dollars
  * Lens: Nikon 50 1.4, 300 dollars
  * Laser:  15Watts Laser, 100 dollars
  * Arduino Uno: 15 dollars
  * Cylindrical lens: around 50 dollars 
  * In total around 1500 dollars, most budget was spend in the camera. I didn't see any cheap alternatives for the camera, if there's any cheaper camera could be applied in the PIV with trigger, please let me know, thanks.
